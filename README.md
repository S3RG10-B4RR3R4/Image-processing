# Image Processing Project

Welcome to the **Image Processing Project**! This project explores different image processing techniques using **Python**, **NumPy**, and **Cython**. We implement and compare the performance of three image filters: **Gaussian**, **Sobel**, and **Median**. The goal is to highlight the performance improvements achieved using NumPy and Cython over pure Python implementations.

## üì¶ Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Image-processing.git
cd Image-processing
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üîß Additional Setup for Cython
After installing the dependencies, you will need to install the Microsoft C++ Build Tools to compile the Cython code on Windows. Follow these steps:

Install Microsoft C++ Build Tools:
- Download and install the tools from the following link: Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools.
- During installation, ensure that you select C++ build tools under the Workloads section.

### üö® Cython Compilation (Windows)
To compile the Cython modules on Windows, you'll need to have the Visual Studio Build Tools installed. If you already have Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools installed, follow these steps:

Run the command to set up the Visual Studio environment:

Open Git Bash or CMD and run the following command to set up the Visual Studio build tools in your terminal:

```bash
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\BuildTools\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvarsall.bat" x64
```
This will configure the environment to use the build tools in the terminal.

**Navigate to the project folder:**

Change the directory to the folder where the setup.py file and Cython code are located:

```bash
cd /c/Users/venta/Downloads/PRUEBA-USO/Image-processing/src
```
**Compile the Cython code:**
Finally, run the following command to compile the Cython file (filters_cython.pyx):

```bash
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```
This step will generate the .pyd file (or .so on other systems) that you can use in your Python project.

## üöÄ Usage

### Step 1: Change to the 'examples' directory
Before running the image processing script, change the directory to the `examples` folder using the following command:

```bash
cd examples
```
### Step 2: Run the image processing script
Once you're in the examples directory, you can run the image_processing.py script by executing:

```bash
python image_processing.py
```

### Step 3: Provide the image path
The script will prompt you to enter the path to your image. 

For example, if your image is located in the `Downloads` folder on a Windows computer, you would enter something like:
```
C:\Users\YourUsername\Downloads\YourFolder\YourImage.jpg
```

Replace `YourUsername` with your actual username, and `YourFolder\YourImage.jpg` with the path to the image you want to process. 

If you're on a different operating system (like macOS or Linux), the path might look like:
```
/Users/YourUsername/Downloads/YourFolder/YourImage.jpg
```

Make sure to provide the correct file path to the image, and the script will handle the rest.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Features

* **Filter Implementations**:
   * Gaussian Filter
   * Sobel Filter
   * Median Filter

* **Performance Comparison**:
   * Detailed execution time analysis for Python, NumPy, and Cython implementations.
   * Visual comparison of the filtered images.

* **Image Formats**: The project works with grayscale images and supports fast processing on larger datasets.

## üìà Performance Analysis

* Measure the time it takes for each filter (Python, NumPy, and Cython) to process an image.
* See the speedup achieved by using **NumPy** and **Cython** over the **pure Python** implementation.

## üì∏ Sample Results

### Filtered Results
* **Gaussian Filter**: A smoothing filter that reduces image noise.
* **Sobel Filter**: Edge detection filter.
* **Median Filter**: Reduces noise while preserving edges.
